\section{Background}

This project aims to investigate how Machine Learning algorithms (e.g. decision trees, random
forests, boosting) compare to more tradition econometric tools such as linear or logistic
regressions, using a real-world dataset \cite{enquete} to study a binary variable using these
different algorithms.

Our objective is twofold:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item compare prediction quality between the different algorithms
    \item compare interpretability of the models and recover marginal effects if possible
\end{enumerate}

\section{Current progress}
\subsection{Research}
On the advice of our supervisor, we have researched the theoretical background of the project. More specifically, we have looked into (and learned) basic Econometrics methods that we will need to apply throughout the project, using \cite{wooldridge}, and in conjunction with the Econometrics I class taught by F. Kramarz. We have also started learning some Machine Learning methods, understanding the basics using online material \cite{vidhya}, and then studying further with the help of \cite{introR}.

\subsection{Setup}
As this project will involve a fair amount of programming, we have also ensured that we have an adequate experimental setup that will allow us to implement the algorithms and experiment in a relatively flexible way, yet also let us record and analyse our results with relative ease.

Our experimental setup revolves around various tools that we have put in place:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \texttt{Python} and \texttt{R} programming languages, along with the \texttt{scikit-learn} machine learning package \cite{python}\cite{R}\cite{learn}
    \item the \texttt{Git} source control manager \cite{git}, which enables us to keep track of different versions of our code (and thus project), while also letting us easily rollback changes, or run multiple versions of the code (e.g. with different parameters)
    \item \texttt{Jupyter} \cite{jupyter}, an interactive computing platform, which enables us to run code directly in the browser, and mix text with code snippets to allow us to document our work properly
\end{itemize}

We have also downloaded the dataset we intend to work with, \emph{Enqu\^ete Emploi en Continu} \cite{enquete}, done some basic manipulations to make it easier to work with (conversions), and started investigating the kinds of data we have access to, as well as running some very basic regressions (more for practice than for finding useful results).

Our work can be found at all times on the project's \href{https://github.com/ncocacola/econml/}{GitHub repository}.
