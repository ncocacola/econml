\section{Future} Over the next weeks (starting after the exam period) and with the agreement of our
supervisor, we intend to advance the project by performing the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item explore the database further to understand what kind of data we have, and what parameters
we would like to include in our models; this entails investigating the various parameters, through
summary statistics and graphical representations
    \item run various classical multiple linear regressions with adequately chosen parameters, to
understand the effects of each of them on our dependent variable (probability of
\texttt{employed}/\texttt{not employed})
    \item run logit and probit regressions, and understand the differences with a regular MLR
regression
    \item move on to machine learning algorithms (decision trees, then random forest and boosting),
and investigate ways in which we can extract marginal effects \end{enumerate}
