\section{Background}
This project aims to investigate how Machine Learning algorithms (e.g. decision trees, random
forests, boosting) compare to more traditional econometric tools such as linear or logistic
regressions, using a real-world dataset \cite{enquete} to study a binary variable with these
various algorithms.

Our objective is twofold:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item compare prediction quality between the various algorithms
    \item compare interpretability of the models and recover marginal effects if possible
\end{enumerate}

This project is supervised by \href{http://www.crest.fr/pagesperso.php?user=3045}{Dr. Romain
Aeberhardt} and \href{http://thomas-larrieu.strikingly.com/}{Thomas Larrieu}.
