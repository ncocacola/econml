\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivations}
The aim of this project was to investigate how Machine Learning algorithms (e.g. decision trees, random forests, boosting) compared to more traditional econometric tools such as linear or logistic regressions, using a real-world dataset \cite{enquete} to study a binary variable with these various algorithms.

Our objective was twofold:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item compare prediction quality between the various algorithms
    \item compare interpretability of the models and recover marginal effects if possible
\end{enumerate}

The project was supervised by \href{http://www.crest.fr/pagesperso.php?user=3045}{Dr. Romain Aeberhardt} and \href{http://thomas-larrieu.strikingly.com/}{Thomas Larrieu}.

\section{Structure}
The remainder of this report is laid out as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Part 2} provides a theoretical overview of usual Econometric and Machine Learning methods
        \item \textbf{Part 3} gives a short overview of our experimental setup
        \item \textbf{Part 4} focuses on the experiments, the results that we find and their interpretation
        \item \textbf{Part 5} contains concluding remarks about our project, as well as ideas for future work.
    \end{itemize}
